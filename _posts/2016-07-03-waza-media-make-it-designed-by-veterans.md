  company, WazaMedia, we create engaging visual and interactive media products
  that focus on creative storytelling through the use of multiple mediums, and
  emphasize the human factor behind amazing products and services.  Our vision
  is a changed media landscape. We believe the way your audience interacts with
  your message is just as important as developing the message itself. We make
  our content available across the vast array of devices we use, and deliver it
  in unique interfaces that allow the user to experience the message.  My
  partner Kyle Ramirez and I were both journalists and U.S. Marines. As great
  friends and collaborators, we have set out to advance the media industry's
  storytelling capabilities through development and thought leadership. Our
  company is the outpouring of our combined 16-years of experience in the
  Marines.  We are obsessed with change and stories that help illustrate the
  human condition. A large part of WazaMedia's culture is studying how emerging
  media technology and practices are affecting public communication standards
  and ways of life. It is with these discoveries that we approach each project,
  and delivers each design.
